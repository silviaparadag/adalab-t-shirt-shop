**## Quick Start Guide**
This repository is a bootcamp exercise.


## 🛠 | Built With

- HTML
- SCSS
- JAVA SCRIPT

## -- Getting Started 💪🏼 --

1. Clone the repo:
   `git clone https://github.com/LaiaRuizM/personal_project_AmznWeb.git`

1. Install NPM packages & dependencies:
   `npm install`

1. Start the project:
   `npm start`

> **Note** In this exercise, we can find the following files and folders:

1. The folder 📂 `src/` is the files of this web page: HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and images.
2. The folders 📚 `public/` and `docs/`, are generated automatically when we start the project. GULP reads the files found in the src/ folder, processes them and then generates them inside `public/` and `docs/`.
3. Other 📝 files found in the repository root as 'gulpfile.js', 'package.json', etc. are configuration files and we don't need to modify them.

#### -- How to publish the project on GitHub Pages? --

To generate your page for production run the command:

```bash
npm run docs
```

Next:

1. In the explorer, a folder called `docs/` will have been created. If it doesn't appear at first, refresh!
2. In the terminal put git add -A, git commit -m "run docs" and git push.
3. Go to the `settings` tab of your repo -> "code and automation" -> in the GitHub Pages section enable the **master branch /docs folder** -> save -> refresh. (IMPORTANT!).
3. It may take a while to create it, because of the deploy. Once the URL has been generated, you can submit it.
4. As a recommendation: Add this URL on the main page of the project, in the ABOUT section.
